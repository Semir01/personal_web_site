                        <p>Hi, I'm Semir Jazvin</p>
                        <p class="main-text-aboutME">
                            An engineer by nature and a software enthusiast by passion. <br>
                            I was born in 2001 in Sarajevo and grew up in the beautiful town of Glavatičevo, where my
                            curiosity for technology and innovation began at an early age. <br>
                            Throughout elementary and high school, I developed a deep interest in electrical
                            engineering, research, and innovation. <br>
                            As the valedictorian of OŠ Glavatičevo, and later a student of the Electrical Engineering
                            High School — specializing in Power Engineering — I built a strong foundation of knowledge
                            and skills. From childhood, working alongside my brother and father, I gained over 10 years
                            of hands-on experience in electrical installations, both low-voltage and high-voltage
                            systems. <br>
                            In 2020, I started my studies at the Faculty of Information Technologies in Mostar. I
                            initially enrolled in Software Engineering and later transferred to the Software Development
                            program. Today, I’m a senior student, combining my two biggest passions — electrical
                            engineering and IT. <br>
                            Over the years, I’ve also worked in two companies, where I further expanded my technical,
                            professional, and teamwork skills. <br>
                            I’m currently focused on advancing my career in the IT field, especially in Full-Stack
                            Development, with the goal of creating projects that combine hardware and software,
                            innovation, and real-world application. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>I’m always striving for new challenges, constant learning, and building solutions that make
                            a meaningful impact.</p>
